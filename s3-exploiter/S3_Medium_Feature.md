# From Enumeration to Exploitation: My First Custom Cloud Pentest Tool

I recently pushed my first public cloud security tool to GitHub â€” an S3 Bucket Exploiter built to discover, enumerate, and test Amazon S3 permissions in red team and lab settings.

What started as a hands-on way to learn AWS misconfigurations quickly turned into a fully tracked CLI project under `cloudpunchr-tools`, now hosted at:  
https://cloudpuncher.dev

## What the Tool Does

- Brute-force and enumerate S3 buckets using a wordlist  
- Test for public access (list/read/write)  
- Detect permission misconfigurations  
- Optionally integrate with AWS CLI for authenticated testing
