# ðŸª£ S3-Exploiter

**S3-Exploiter** is an educational tool designed for cloud penetration testing practice against *intentionally misconfigured* or *authorized lab* AWS S3 buckets. It automates common enumeration and exploitation steps to identify public buckets, test access levels, and optionally attempt safe file uploads/downloads.

> ðŸ”’ **This tool is strictly for educational and authorized testing environments only. Do not use against live systems without explicit permission.**

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Identify open and publicly accessible S3 buckets
- Detect read/write/list permissions
- Attempt object enumeration and basic file operations
- Optional integration with `awscli` for authenticated testing
- Save findings in structured output for reporting

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siestakeydbc/cloudpunchr-tools.git
cd cloudpunchr-tools/s3-exploiter
chmod +x s3-exploiter.sh
./s3-exploiter.sh -b my-bucket-name
Usage: ./s3-exploiter.sh -b <bucket-name> [options]

Options:
  -b <bucket-name>   Target S3 bucket name
  -l                 List accessible objects
  -r                 Attempt read/download
  -w                 Attempt write/upload
  -a                 Perform all operations
  -h                 Display help
$ ./s3-exploiter.sh -b test-bucket-public -a

[*] Testing bucket: test-bucket-public
[+] Bucket is PUBLICLY accessible!
[+] Read access: SUCCESS
[+] Write access: POSSIBLE (test file uploaded)
[+] List objects: ENABLED

[*] Enumerated Files:
  - index.html
  - config.json
  - secrets.env

Example CLI Output
<pre>
<strong>1. Full-access S3 bucket scan:</strong>

$ ./s3-exploiter.sh -b public-reports -a

[*] Testing bucket: public-reports
[+] Bucket is PUBLICLY accessible!
[+] Read access: SUCCESS
[+] Write access: SUCCESS (test.txt uploaded)
[+] List objects: ENABLED

[*] Enumerated Objects:
  - annual_report.pdf
  - credentials_backup.zip
  - dev_config.yaml
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>2. Read-only bucket discovery:</strong>

$ ./s3-exploiter.sh -b training-assets -l

[*] Testing bucket: training-assets
[+] Bucket is PUBLICLY accessible!
[+] Read access: SUCCESS
[!] Write access: DENIED
[+] List objects: ENABLED

[*] Files Found:
  - webshell.jpg
  - index.html
</pre>
<pre>
<strong>3. Unauthorized access attempt:</strong>

$ ./s3-exploiter.sh -b prod-files

[*] Testing bucket: prod-files
[-] Bucket is NOT publicly accessible or permission denied.
</pre>
## ðŸš§ Future Enhancements

- Add AWS authentication flow with temporary credentials via STS
- Support for recursive enumeration of nested folders
- Export results to JSON/CSV formats for reporting
- Integrate with tools like `Amass` or `Subfinder` for passive bucket discovery
- Add a `--dry-run` mode for safe testing before execution
